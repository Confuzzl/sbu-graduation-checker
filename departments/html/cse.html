  <p>This multidisciplinary class surveys how computer science and computer technology are used in sculpture. Case studies with slides, videos, and software demonstrations illustrate a range of approaches of sculptors incorporating computers in their creative process. Various state-of-the art fabrication technologies are studied (with site visits if available on campus). Mathematical foundations are emphasized so students can recognize them when analyzing sculpture and choose the right tool when designing. In the weekly laboratory, these ideas are reinforced with projects using a range of available software and inexpensive construction materials, e.g., paper, cardboard, and foamcore.</p>

  <h3>CSE 356: Cloud Computing</h3>
  <p>Creating online services capable of handling millions of users requires a different mindset compared to traditional software development and deployment. Rather than building monolithic software packages from the ground up, bringing up modern online services calls for architecting systems by gluing together mature existing technologies deployed across many unreliable servers, working in concert to provide high-availability robust services. In this course, students will be exposed to the concepts and technologies behind deploying and scaling online services on the computing resources available in modern datacenters.</p>
