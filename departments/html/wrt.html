  <h3>WRT 305: Writing for the Health Professions</h3>
  <p>Enables students interested in a health care career to strengthen their critical writing skills.  While learning to gather information and to apply ethical principles in a logical, persuasive fashion, students will explore and write about various types of evidence concerning the health care needs of different populations: a field research project on a health issue affecting a local target population of their choice, a critique of government documents that contain data on that issue and population, and a review of scholarly research on the same issue as it affects the larger national population represented by that local one.  Writing assignments will include drafts and final versions of a research proposal, field research results, numerical analysis, literature review and a final project incorporating all of the previous work conducted about that issue and population. Students will also write a reflective paper which can serve as the basis for a personal statement for medical or other health-related graduate school applications.

Class discussions and writing assignments will be organized around two mutually informing themes: first, consideration will be given to the rhetorical strategies experts use to produce technical arguments; second, emphasis will be placed on how non-experts interact with and contest those arguments. This course will address issues of power, access, and social justice as it traces how scientific discourses move among diverse audiences. To that end, writing assignments will ask students to 1) analyze medical and scientific texts, 2) modify those texts to fit the unique demands of a particular community, and 3) conduct sustained original research into a scientific or medical controversy of their choosing.</p><p>

Using real nonprofits or other organizations as an example, students will apply theories of organizational rhetoric, visual rhetoric, genre, and more to analyze the ways in which a business internally communicates and externally presents itself in its public facing texts and artifacts particularly with an eye toward diversity, equity and inclusion and assumed power structures. For the first half of the class, students will choose a business or nonprofit organization to formally research, analyze and create content for. Genres include an organizational rhetorical analysis report, a writing profile, a researched spotlight brief and a video message. Students will then present their work in a 10 to 15-minute formal presentation, peer reviewed by the class. The second half of the semester, the class will partner with one or more businesses or local nonprofits through Stony Brook University's Center for Service Learning and Community Service (CSLCS). Using an asset based approach, students will work in groups to collaborate with the organization(s) to learn their needs then using what they learned from the first half, write mini white papers which will then be combined into a Collaborative White Paper for the organization(s).</p><p>

  <h3>WRT 321: Writing for Social Justice</h3>
  <p>"This course grapples with the complex historical partnership  between writing/language and social justice: the manifestos, poetry, essays, editorials and political statements, the films, speeches, wall writing, testimonials and posters and zines from the many contexts in which people use language to move society toward equity and justice--even activist technical and professional writing that aims to change systemic inequities through the (re)writing of bureaucratic and policy texts. We will consider language broadly by looking at and experimenting with a range of communicative forms recruited to address social justice.

  <h3>WRT 376: Digital Rhetorics</h3>
  <p>In antiquity, rhetoric was an art of persuasion carried out through the medium of voice. Since the printing press, rhetoric and composition have been concerned with rhetoric in written word. Today, in the 21st century, we face digitality, defying any attempt to easily delineate speech, writing, and visuality. What does it mean to compose, interpret, and argue through digitality? What does it mean to practice rhetoric as a civic art when our communities are global and hyperconnected? This course explores the subfield of digital rhetoric, which aims to capture answers to these questions and more.</p>

  <h3>WRT 380: Advanced Research Writing: Theories, Methods, Practices</h3>
  <p>Good research skills are critical to academic success.  Most disciplines require writing based upon research, as arguments and explanations make little impact on audiences without effective supporting evidence, drawn from relevant scholarship on the subject. This involves knowing how to use appropriate databases, source materials, and composing processes, as well as negotiating the values, genres, and languages of the scholarly communities in which one is researching.  In this course, students will learn fundamentals of research methods, practice these methods in a series of integrated research and writing assignments, and engage in critical reflection about research and writing.  Students will focus on an area of disciplinary interest to them, and practice these essential research and writing skills through a series of projects: library assignments, research log, research proposal, annotated bibliography, literature review, abstract, research paper and reflection paper.</p>

  <h3>WRT 381: Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing</h3>
  <p>Argumentative writing involves making a claim and supporting it with specific, related points and appropriate evidence--in other words, it is thesis-driven writing. Whenever we don't quite like someone else's idea and we want him or her to come closer to ours, argumentative writing is the most efficient method for such persuasion, in whatever profession you're considering. This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies.  Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages--proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review--culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration.  This course will fulfill the second half of the Writing Pre-Med/Pre-Health prerequisite. Covers the
Interdisciplinary topic for the English major. This course is offered as both <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/egl/#381" title="Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing">EGL 381</a> and <a href="/bulletin/current/courses/wrt/#381" title="Advanced Analytic and Argumentative Writing">WRT 381</a>.</p>

  <h3>WRT 382: Grant Writing</h3>
  <p>Introduces students to the fundamentals of seeking and writing scholarly grants to fund research-based projects, from the earliest stages of planning to the completion of the grant application. In consultation with the instructor, each student works for the entire semester on applying for a real grant that is external to Stony Brook University. Key subjects to be taught include understanding funders and funding opportunities, researching and locating one's position in the disciplinary field of the grant, articulating relevant problems in that field, specifying appropriate and evidence-based solutions, addressing specific audiences, and utilizing rhetorical appeals. In addition to frequent low-stakes writing tasks, the course requires three high-stakes written projects: a literature review, a research proposal, and a grant application along with an abstract.</p>

  <h3>WRT 392: Theories and Methods of Mentoring Writers</h3>
  <p>Closely examines the difficulties implicit in mentoring writers, with special consideration for the roles of cultural expectations and social dynamics on both the teaching of writing and writers themselves. In small groups and one-to-one interactions, students explore theories and practices upon which composition instruction and writing center work depend. Building on the understanding that writing is a recursive process (a cycle of planning, drafting, revising, and editing), students also learn to analyze and problem-solve issues that become barriers for effective writing and communication.</p>

  <h3>WRT 444: Experiential Learning</h3>
  <p>This course is designed for students who engage in a substantial, structured experiential learning activity in conjunction with another class. Experiential learning occurs when knowledge acquired through formal learning and past experience are applied to a "real-world" setting or problem to create new knowledge through a process of reflection, critical analysis, feedback and synthesis. Beyond-the-classroom experiences that support experiential learning may include: service learning, mentored research, field work, or an internship.</p>
