However, scholars have recently begun to explore the possibility that biological differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political attitudes and behavior. This course explores the relationship between biology and political behavior with an emphasis on how the two may be linked. We examine human political behavior from evolutionary, genetic, and neurobiological perspectives, considering literature on non-human animals, developmental psychology, personality, psychophysiology, neurobiology, genetics, hormones, disgust sensitivity, and mating.</p><p>

We compare human social behavior to similar behaviors observed in chimpanzees, baboons, dolphins, honeybees, and other animal species. We look at behaviors such as altruism, mating, fighting, dominance hierarchies, alliances, punishment, trade, risk sharing, group decision-making, social learning, and culture. For each social behavior, we consider the underlying psychological systems, how they process information, and what evolutionary functions they perform. We will focus particularly on evidence from experiments. Finally, we explore how humans invent new political institutions that extend our evolved political strategies.</p><p>

  <p>This course is designed for students who engage in a substantial, structured experiential learning activity in conjunction with another class. Experiential learning occurs when knowledge acquired through formal learning and past experience are applied to a "real-world" setting or problem to create new knowledge through a process of reflection, critical analysis, feedback and synthesis. Beyond-the-classroom experiences that support experiential learning may include: service learning, mentored research, field work, or an internship.</p>
