Basic concepts in classical mechanics and fluid dynamics are used to analyze particular actions in football, baseball, soccer, track and field, and other sports. Students learn, for example, about the knuckle ball in baseball and why it is so hard to hit, and why quarterbacks throw a football in a spiral. The concepts of heat, energy, and calories are also discussed.

What does quantum mechanics mean, if anything, for philosophy, ethics, and social behavior?  At the same time, we shall look into how social and cultural influences may have affected the way that quantum mechanics was formulated, and how it has evolved.   We shall review the early history of quantum mechanics, and discuss some of the important debates at the founding of quantum mechanics.   Students will not be expected to learn the mathematics in depth, only the introduction provided by the instructors aimed at non-science students.  Besides readings, the course will also involve plays, films, and guest speakers.  Students will be expected to work on a final project, to be presented in class.
