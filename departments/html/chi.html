At the same time, it has more speakers than any other language spoken in the modern world.  This course, which is taught in English, provides an introduction to the phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and writing system of the Mandarin Chinese language.  It is designed to familiarize students with some fundamental knowledge of the structure of spoken and written Mandarin Chinese.  Specifically, it aims to enable the students to acquire an understanding of basic methods used by linguists to observe and gather Mandarin Chinese data, to delineate structural properties with regard to the sound, tone, word, grammar, and discourse of the language, and to develop a basic typological comparison between Mandarin Chinese and English.</p><p>

  <h3>CHI 444: Experiential Learning</h3>
  <p>This course is designed for students who engage in a substantial, structured experiential learning activity in conjunction with another class. Experiential learning occurs when knowledge acquired through formal learning and past experience are applied to a "real-world" setting or problem to create new knowledge through a process of reflection, critical analysis, feedback and synthesis. Beyond-the-classroom experiences that support experiential learning may include: service learning, mentored research, field work, or an internship.</p>
