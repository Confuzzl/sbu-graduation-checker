The project must be approved before the start of the student's senior year. On completion, the thesis is reviewed by the advisor and one other member of the Philosophy faculty and by a faculty member from outside the Department. The honors thesis is then the focus of an oral examination. Honors are awarded upon passage of the examination.</p>
