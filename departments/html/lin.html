Students will acquire general analytical tools that will allow them to understand complex words that they may not have previously encountered.

  <h3>LIN 120: Language and Technology</h3>
  <p>An introduction to how computers process language and solve language-related tasks. This course discusses the language technologies of our daily life --- spam filtering, machine translation, and many more --- and shows how they work under the hood. The course explores a variety of issues: Why do computers do well in some areas (spell checking) yet fail miserably in others (essay grading)? Will we ever have perfectly fluent AIs as depicted in science fiction? And how will these technological advances impact the role of language in our society? Students will also acquire basic programming skills and write scripts for simple language tasks. No previous training in mathematics or computer science required.</p>

In the discussion of Spanish in the U.S., the course introduces concepts revolving around language contact, language use, grammar, language attitudes, heritage speakers, bilingualism, code-switching, and language shift and maintenance. The course will focus on the Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban communities in the U.S. from the point of view of dialectal and sociolectal distribution, but also discusses European settlement and migration patterns. Finally the course will examine the role of Spanish in Education and the future of the Spanish language in the US.

  <h3>LIN 280: Language in Social Media</h3>
  <p>Social media came into being along with the internet in the 1990s, and have rapidly become an ubiquitous form of communication and information.  This course provides an exploration of how language is used in social media, and how language in social media can be analyzed.  We start out by understanding how humans form social networks and what the properties of these networks are.  We then compare how the emergence of social media has changed the manner in which we humans communicate, and investigate possible positive and negative effects of this change.  One of the major effects is that many more people are 'publishing' today, and we will discover how this has affected public language use.  We also discuss the technology behind social media, and learn about the dangers in social media.  We also discuss the technologies used in social media, and learn about the potential and the dangers that lie in these technologies.</p>

  <p>An introduction to the sound systems of languages focusing on the mental representation of sound structure: how speakers use knowledge of their language to assign meaning to different combinations of sounds. We will examine data from a number of languages to explore the differences and similarities among the sound patterns of different languages, and will consider the question of whether there are universal preferences for specific types of sounds and sound sequences.</p>

Topics include basic speech acoustics, acoustic analysis, oral and nasal airflow, static palatography, linguography and electroglottography, as well as design of perception experiments.  Students will learn the physical processes affecting each experimental variable and common methods of analyzing each kind of data. Students will get hands-on experience with each analysis method and will use two or more types of data to explore a hypothesis about sound structure in English or some other language of interest. Students will learn how to use software for making measurements and analyzing data. Students will learn to assess the validity of claims about language based on their understanding of the scientific method as applied to speech.
